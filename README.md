# JetBrains Academy Blockchain Project

An example of a passing solution to the final phase of the JetBrains Academy Java Blockchain project.

## Description

The relative directory structure was kept the same as the one used in my JetBrains Academy solution.

The program logs to a file called "blockchain.log" in your home folder.
